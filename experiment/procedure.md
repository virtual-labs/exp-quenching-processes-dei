### Procedure

1. Go to the **Simulation** tab.
2. A modal window will appear with the **Quenching Process** option - click on it to proceed.
3. Read the **Theory** section carefully to understand the quenching heat treatment process.
4. You will be directed to the **Quenching Setup** page. Observe the video simulation attentively to understand the process and strain distribution.
5. Use the sidebar navigation to click on **Quenching with Strain** to view the second simulation.
6. Watch the strain visualization video carefully to observe temperature changes and equivalent strains during the quenching process.
7. After completing both simulations, click on the **"← Back to Selection"** button in the sidebar to return to the main selection screen.
8. You can restart the simulation by selecting the Quenching Process again from the modal.
