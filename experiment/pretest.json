      "question": "What does C refers to in AC3 Temperature:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Chauffage",
        "b": "Chauffer",
        "c": "Critical",
        "d": "Condensing"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Chauffage refers to heating, not the critical temperature designation.",
        "b": "Chauffer means to heat in French, but is not used here.",
        "c": "C in AC3 denotes the critical temperature at which austenite formation is complete.",
        "d": "Condensing has no relevance in heat treatment."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c"

      "question": "Water cooling rate is _______ to critical cooling rate:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Higher",
        "b": "Lower",
        "c": "Equal",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Water provides a cooling rate higher than the critical cooling rate required for martensite formation.",
        "b": "Lower cooling rate would not form martensite.",
        "c": "Equal cooling rate is not practically observed.",
        "d": "Incorrect because water cooling is higher."
      },

        "d": "Transformation Temperature Time"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is unrelated to metallurgy.",
        "b": "Incorrect sequence of terms.",
        "c": "TTT diagram represents Temperature–Time–Transformation behavior.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Pearlite forms during slow cooling.",
        "b": "Austenite exists only at high temperature.",
        "c": "Martensite forms due to rapid quenching.",
        "d": "Incorrect because martensite is formed."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Air provides the slowest cooling rate.",
        "b": "Oil cools faster than air.",
