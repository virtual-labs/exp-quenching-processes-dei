      "question": "After Forging process ______ is done:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Quenching",
        "b": "Annealing",
        "c": "Casting",
        "d": "Nitriding"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Direct quenching may cause defects.",
        "b": "Annealing is done to homogenize microstructure after forging.",
        "c": "Casting is a manufacturing process, not post-forging.",
        "d": "Nitriding is a surface treatment."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b"

    {
      "question": "Maximum equivalent strains occur ______:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "At Surface",
        "b": "In Core",
        "c": "Same Everywhere",
        "d": "Does not occur"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Surface experiences maximum deformation and cooling rate.",
        "b": "Core deforms less due to constraint.",
        "c": "Strain distribution is non-uniform.",
        "d": "Strain always occurs during quenching."

        "d": "Toughness"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Strength increases but hardness is the primary effect.",
        "b": "Machinability usually decreases.",
        "c": "Martensite formation significantly increases hardness.",
        "d": "Toughness generally decreases."

        "c": "Curve of continuous cooling",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is a volume unit, unrelated to metallurgy.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Red color conventionally indicates maximum temperature.",
        "b": "Green indicates moderate temperature.",
        "c": "Blue indicates low temperature.",
        "d": "Yellow is lower than red in thermal scale."
