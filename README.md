### About the Experiment 

The heat treatment is a very important step in the series of processes used to manufacture a metal part. It gives to the material most of its final characteristics (micro structure, strength, hardness). Generally after hot forging of blooms, the microstructure is severely affected. In order to homogenize the microstructure annealing is done and then quenched in appropriate medium.
